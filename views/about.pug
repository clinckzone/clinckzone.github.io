    p Hello, I'm Divyanshu. As a 
      span.bold Full Stack Engineer 
      | with a focus on 
      span.bold frontend development
      |, I'm at the beginning of my journey in the tech industry. I have a genuine interest in human-computer interfaces and am eager to explore and contribute to its evolution. In my recent role at 
      a(href="https://chroniclehq.com/") Chronicle
      |, I had the opportunity to collaborate on projects that aimed to enhance the way we create and deliver presentation experiences.


    p I hold a degree in Architecture from IIT Roorkee, class of 2022. This academic foundation has instilled in me a nuanced understanding of technology, allowing me to approach it not just as a tool, but as an art form that melds functionality, efficiency, and user experience.

        p At Chronicle, a startup revolutionizing presentation delivery, I transitioned from an intern to a full-time Software Engineer, spearheading the implementation of key features like the "Image Picker" and enhancing user interfaces. Collaborating closely with Product Managers and Designers, I also played a pivotal role in refining slide block addition mechanisms and supporting senior engineers in bug resolution.
