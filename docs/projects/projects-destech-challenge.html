This article aims to explain the submission that we gave in as our entry for this challenge. For this challenge, We were required to design a digital platform to capture local urban trails through smartphones to let creatives capture, encapsulate and share their journey in a meaningful way.</p><h2>About</h2><p>DesTech Challenge is a unique national design competition in the sense that it aims to bring creative thinking and digital advancements in the built environment sector together. It challenges creative thinkers to explore opportunities within ‚ÄòSmart City‚Äô systems, processes and engagement strategies.</p><ul class="single"><li class="image"><img src="../images/projects-destech-challenge-01.png" alt="The essence of Destech Challenge"><span>The essence of Destech Challenge</span></li></ul><p>It sets itself apart from conventional design competitions by providing mentoring and research inputs from international experts to bring the best out of the participants. The challenge encourages participants to collaborate with fast-emerging digital sectors as well as local citizens to bring forward innovative ideas.</p><h2>Challenge</h2><p>Architects see the world with a creative lens. They capture their experiences through a range of mediums and build their ideas through inspirations that they come across in their environment.</p><p>What if they can encapsulate their experiences in a meaningful way and share it through the medium of a common platform? Imagine the possibilities generated with this exchange of thoughts to create new and innovative ideas!</p><ul class="single"><li class="image"><img src="../images/projects-destech-challenge-02.png" alt="Architects use inspiration to solve problems"><span>Architects use inspiration to solve problems</span></li></ul><p>What if they can encapsulate their experiences in a meaningful way and share it through the medium of a common platform?

A large part of their work and lifestyle revolves around travelling and visiting new or the same old places. With travel, we not only refer to travelling to far off sites but also to the ones that are local to them. For each such visit, the reason might be different:</p><ul><li>A lot of times, architects are required to go for <span class="bold">site visits¬†</span>at various stages of their ongoing projects. These visits are essential for several reasons: Firstly, they help the architect to become familiar with the site. Secondly, a lot of ideas and creativity pops up onsite. Thirdly, an architect is not only responsible for his design but its proper implementation and management also. Hence these site visits allow him to observe a project‚Äôs progress carefully.   </li><li>Students also go for <span class="bold">site visits </span>for similar reasons. They don‚Äôt do it for management purposes though since their projects are generally for their design studios and hence aren‚Äôt implemented in real life.</li><li>One may also travel for <span class="bold">documentation¬†</span>purposes. Architectural documentation aims to understand the logical reasons behind the implementation of various visual and non-visual elements in the design to complement its functionality.</li><li>Search for¬†<span class="bold">inspiration¬†</span>may also drive such pursuits.</li><li>It may also be a¬†<span class="bold">casual exploration¬†</span>of a new built environment to learn about and experience new cultures, people, architectural styles, etc.</li></ul><h3>Needs and Problems</h3><p>To better empathise with our users, we started off by imagining ourselves on a similar journey. Through this exercise, we looked for their needs and potential problems that may be solved using technology:</p><ul><li>What are the places he/she has explored, and what yet remains to explore?</li><li>How should one go about finding new places and built forms to visit as per their interests?</li><li>What is the accessibility of a location from one‚Äôs desired place of interest?</li><li>What are the local means of transportation available to one?</li><li>What are some intermediate attractions that he/she might be interested in checking out?</li><li>What are the different kinds of architectural elements present in a building?</li><li>What is the architectural style of a built form?</li><li>How vital a built-form is from an architectural point of view?</li><li>What are the ways in which one can share his ideas, opinions, knowledge, insights about a particular topic/experience?</li><li>How can one know about the ideas, experiences, opinions, insights of others?</li></ul><h3>Design Concept</h3><p>Day to day activities involves the creation of data in huge bulks which in turn brings out the need to store, retrieve, edit, organise, share and extract useful information out of it. To deliver an exceptional experience, we aim to use data capturing and processing techniques to produce upon the following:</p><ul class="single"><li class="image"><img src="../images/projects-destech-challenge-05.png" alt="Core concepts behind the making"><span>Core concepts behind the making</span></li></ul><ol><li> <span class="bold">Capture </span>videos, photos, and text in the form of posts and articles.</li><li> <span class="bold">Encapsulate </span>and¬†<span class="bold">organise </span>the same to provide meaningful insights about a place or built form along with receiving ideas on it from others.</li><li> <span class="bold">Automated processing </span>of this data to automatically tag and classify user-generated content.</li><li> <span class="bold">Search </span>for information that has been shared by other users under various categories.</li><li> <span class="bold">Visualisations </span>to provide insights into the popularity, history, density, walkability, accessibility, mobility and weather of a place or a building.</li><li> <span class="bold">Motivating </span>users to explore beyond what they have already seen and experienced.</li><li>Finding and planning <span class="bold">optimised </span>routes by one‚Äôs interest and previous interaction with the application.</li></ol><h3>Features</h3><p> <span class="bold">Capture: </span>Capture data about the site or place in the form of photos, videos, and text and then post it as a new¬†<span class="bold">tile </span>to share it with the rest of the world.</p><p><span class="bold">Feed:¬†</span>Captured data is first organised and then displayed in the form of a post consisting of pictures, videos, and text. Posts are shown in the feed, following one‚Äôs interest and people whom he/she follows in the community. Here we have termed a¬†<span class="bold">‚ÄúPost‚Äù </span>as¬†<span class="bold">‚ÄúTile‚Äù¬†</span>since we are designing in the context of architecture specifically.</p><ul class="single"><li class="image"><img src="../images/projects-destech-challenge-06.png" alt="Process captured data to generate user feed"><span>Process captured data to generate user feed</span></li></ul><ul><li>A tile can be shared or given stars by users in case they find it useful. This way, the post gains popularity gets spread to other users of the community.</li><li>The visual content of a tile(pictures and videos) is uploaded on a cloud server which then analyses it for architectural elements present in it using¬†Machine Learning algorithms. Detected parts are then processed together to classify the type of architecture it belongs to.</li><li>Each tile has a comment section to promote discussion within the community.</li></ul><ul class="single"><li class="image"><img src="../images/projects-destech-challenge-07.png" alt="Automated tagging and classification of elements"><span>Automated tagging and classification of elements</span></li></ul><p> <span class="bold">Search: </span>A user can search for information under various categories using this feature.

Travellers can personally connect on chat with other users present on the platform using the messaging section. Users are regularly notified about the new happenings around them to which they have subscribed via the notification section.<ul class="single"><li class="image"><img src="../images/projects-destech-challenge-12.png" alt="Profile screen"><span>Profile screen</span></li></ul><h3>Flow</h3><ul class="single"><li class="image expand" style="width: 120%"><img src="../images/projects-destech-challenge-13.png" alt="Application flow"><span>Application flow</span></li></ul><h3>Screens</h3><ul class="single"><li class="image expand" style="width: 150%"><img src="../images/projects-destech-challenge-14.png" alt="Application Screens"><span>Application Screens</span></li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>This was the first time that I participated in NASA. Since I had prior experience of designing for the digital media, my team had an upper hand in the competition and our major challenge was to come up with features that are unique and feasible at the same time. Participating in this competition not only improved my product design skills in general but also made me more knowledgable in the domain of architecture itself.</p></div><div class="commentbox"></div><script src="https://unpkg.com/commentbox.io/dist/commentBox.min.js"></script><script>commentBox('5677123549265920-proj')</script><div class="footer"><div class="links"><a class="fa fa-twitter" href="https://twitter.com/clinckzone" alt="Twitter"></a><a class="fa fa-youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MrDivyanshu33" alt="Youtube"></a><a class="fa fa-behance" href="https://www.behance.net/divyanshu33" alt="Behance"></a><a class="fa fa-github" href="https://github.com/clinckzone" alt="Github"></a><a class="fa fa-linkedin" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/divyanshu-tiwari33/" alt="Linkedin"></a><a class="fa fa-envelope" href="mailto:dtiwari@ar.iitr.ac.in?"></a></div></div></body></html>
