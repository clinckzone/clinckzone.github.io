# portfolio-website
This is my personal website. Feel free to use it as a ready-made template for your own website if you want, just keep a backlink to my website as credit :P

## Setup
To start local development follow the regular process -
```js
  npm install
  npm start
```
No need for a build step since all pages are static, and there's hardly any javascript that I have used.
