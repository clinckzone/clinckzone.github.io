# portfolio-website

This is my personal website. Feel free to use it as a ready-made template for your own website if you want, just keep a backlink to my website as credit :P

## Setup for local development

To start local development, follow the regular process -

```js
  npm install
  npm start
```

No need for a build step since all pages are static, and there's hardly any javascript files to serve from the server.
