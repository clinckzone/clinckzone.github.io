    h2 Short Summary
    p With an exponential rise in technology, there is an increasing need for children to be literate in programming. However, most schools in India do not have proper access to desktop computers for teaching due to a lack of funds. For this purpose, we propose 'Coodle', a low-cost tangible

      | programming system to help kids from low-income households in India learn and practice programming intuitively and engagingly. The system makes use of paper/cardboard blocks to make programs. It also consists of a mobile application that can then capture a snapshot of this program. The image is then processed, compiled and executed as a visual output on the mobile's screen.

    h2 Introduction
    p With the rapid growth of technology in today's era, it has become ever more critical that children's current generation develops a preliminary understanding of how computers are programmed and develop an understanding relationship with their digital world. In a country like India that lacks proper access to desktop computers in most of its schools, it requires an alternate solution that can better adapt to its current economic condition. 

    p To address this problem, we have developed 'Coodle', a low-cost tangible programming system that uses paper/cardboard blocks to make programs. It also consists of a mobile application that can then capture a snapshot of this program. The image is then processed over the internet, and the resulting compiled program is executed on the mobile screen as a visual output.

    p Coodle leverages the impact of two significant changes that India has witnessed in its digital infrastructure in the recent past:

    ul
      li There has been a boom in internet access and usage throughout the country due to affordable internet prices.
      li There has been a considerable increase in the availability of cheap smartphones in the Indian market.

    p These changes enable Coodle to be a low-cost alternative for kids to learn to program.

        span A Coodle program that draws a triangle upon execution. During execution, the application also displays the current line that is being executed.

    h2 User Interface
    p There are two parts to the user interface of Coodle. Firstly, there is a tangible component composed of paper/cardboard blocks that can be freely arranged anywhere to make programs. Then there is a digital component based on mobile. It captures the program's image and then processes, compiles and executes it as a visual output on its screen. In this section, we describe both of these parts individually.

    h3 Blocks
    p With Coodle, we sought to deliver an engaging experience that could support and encourage collaboration. Hence the choice of interface for programming became important. Practically it is possible to write programs using interfaces like keyboards, mouse or even mobile phones. However, it becomes difficult and challenging to foster a group learning environment when multiple participants are involved. Tangibles naturally promote this collaborative environment where multiple participants can simultaneously participate, experiment and work on the same problem playfully. Moreover, traditional teaching methods have always emphasized teaching a particular programming language and its syntax rather than problem-solving. Using tangibles, we can reduce the cognitive burden on children by allowing them to select from a deck of cards instead of having them to memorize syntax rules.

    p Coodle's programming language is reasonably straightforward, designed to teach kids the basic concepts of programming. This includes concepts like sequential processing of commands, conditional branching and iterations. Like Logo and Code Weaver, the program comprises of 'opcodes' and 'operands', with each being represented by a physical block. Opcode identifies the type of command, while operand expresses the parameters or numbers related to the command.

    p While designing the language blocks, three main aspects were mainly taken care of: its colour, symbol, and text. Each block has been assigned a different symbol so that its function and usage is visually understandable. Also, blocks of different types have been assigned different colours so that it becomes easier to identify nested chunks of blocks. For example, START and STOP blocks are in red to map out the entire territory within which the program resides.

        img(src="../projects-coodle-03.png", alt="Coodle command blocks")
        span Coommand blocks available in Coodle

    h3 Mobile and Web application
    p The mobile application is meant for capturing snapshots of the blocks. The captured image is then processed and executed as a visual output on the screen. The application offers three different modes: Learn, Draw and Play. Each mode is meant to offer children different learning experiences. Learn mode helps children gradually learn the intricacies of Programming concepts through hand-on tutorials, while Play mode lets them apply their newly learnt skills in solving puzzles. Finally, the Draw mode is a sandbox meant for experimentation.

    p To complement our mobile application, we have also provided a corresponding web application which can be accessed using a desktop computer and can easily be used by connecting a webcam to the computer. It has all the features and functionalities of its mobile counterpart but is mainly meant for teachers to demonstrate Coodle's functionalities to the entire classroom.

    h2 Implementation
    p To successfully compile and execute a program, we first apply image recognition on the program's captured image to detect the different code blocks and their locations. Once we have a digital sequence of these blocks (called tokens), it is compiled using our own set of language rules to generate an AST (Abstract syntax tree) in Javascript. For execution, we analyze every subtree in Javascript, executing different functions for different operators and finally translating them into a sequence of animations using custom Javascript functions that render a different visual output for different opcodes and operands. In the subsections below, we provide a more detailed description of our implementation.

    ul.single
      li.image(style="width: 75%")
        img(src="../projects-coodle-05.png", alt="Implementation details")
        span A backend server processes the image for language tokens and sends them back to the mobile for execution.

    h3 Object Detection
    p To generate a digital sequence of blocks, we first separate each block from the program's entire image. We use the Canny edge detection
      sup [
            a(href="#2") 2
            | ]
      |algorithm for separating the edges of the block and then segment them based on the area covered by their edges. We then create a list of blocks in the order of their appearance in the image using coordinates of their bounding boxes obtained from the Canny edge detection algorithm. We then apply the YOLO
      sup [
          a(href="#3") 3
          | ]
      |detection algorithm on each block separately to obtain the type of opcode or operand they represent. In this way, a list of tokens is generated that can be passed to the interpreter.

    h3 Syntax Analysis
    p Now that we have a sequence of tokens with their corresponding line numbers, the next step is to perform a syntax analysis to generate an AST that can be executed. A Recursive descent parser written in Javascript is fed the detected sequence of tokens as input, producing the desired AST.

    h3 Execution
    p Once the user hits the play button after compilation, the application begins traversing the AST from top to bottom in left to right direction. Based on the node type of AST, we perform different operations. For example, when we encounter the node ROTATE 90, it becomes a function call to rotate(90). For each atomic operation, we have a corresponding Javascript API written using p5.js
      sup [
            a(href="#4") 4
            | ]
      |, which translates the command into visuals on the p5.js canvas. Alternatively, in case of an IF-ELSE type node, we check the condition, and execute the left subtree if the condition is true, or the right subtree if the condition is false.
