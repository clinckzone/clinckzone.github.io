		h2 Overview   
		p This research work tries to answer whether a live updated bird's eye view or a written description of the same would help in navigation using spatial landmarks in coloured and black/white environment setting.

		p The experiment was setup in a virtual environment (VE) software. Sixty-nine participants (49 males 20 females) between the ages of 18 to 35 years volunteered in the study. There were four experimental conditions, mainly: Instruction with Bird's eye view, Instruction without Bird's eye view, No Instruction with Bird's eye view, and No Instruction without Bird's eye view in the study. After an intial exploration of the virtual environment, participants were assigned a test, divided into two halves, with a 5-minute break to reduce the learning effects of the trail. Individuals were given four-coloured and black-and-white (B/W) trails in randomized order. Participants finished the second half of the experiment after taking an activity break.

		p The study demonstrated the importance of route instructions on landmark identification; this was shown under conditions of both coloured and B/W environments. The results also suggest that the wayfinding can be brought down with a visually represented route instruction, which is relatively independent of the context.
		
		h2 Contribution
		p In this project, I was primarily responsible for developing the virtual environment on Unity. This was used to collect behavioural data of users by testing their performance on particular tasks. Below is a demonstration video of the software that was finally used in the experiment.

		p I also developed visualizations for participantâ€™s behavioural data thus collected to help my supervisor gain insights into their behaviour. These visualizations were created programmatically using Processing 3.
