I began my journey here first as an intern before transitioning to a full-time software engineer role. Apart from helping out the senior team members in addressing and rectifying critical product bugs, I contributed to several facets of the software which I have <span class="bold">chronicled </span>below.  </p><p>Chronicle follows a <span class="bold">block </span>based approach for creating slides in your a presentation. There are a variety of pre-made beautiful blocks available for you to help you out. Before we go ahead and try delving deeper into the work described above, here are a few terms that would aid in understanding: </p><ul><li> <p><span class="bold">Forward slash menu: </span>The way you add blocks into your slides is by either pressing the <span class="bold">forward slash </span>button or clicking on the <span class="bold">'plus' </span>button on the right hand side. This opens up a side-drawer from where you can search and select the desired block. This menu is completely navigable through keyboard too.</p></li><li> <p><span class="bold">Block toolbar: </span>Once the block is added to your slide, you can edit the properties of the block by selecting it. A toolbar pops up above the block once it is selected, and from there you can edit its properties. </p></li><li> <p><span class="bold">Contextual menu: </span>Inside this block toolbar, you would find a three dot icon which you can click. This opens up a menu that holds the same block edit commands as in the toolbar. This menu can also be opened using <span class="bold">'Cmd + /'</span>shortcut. You can search and select the properties you want to edit. The menu is completely navigable through the keyboard too. </p></li></ul><h3>Image Picker</h3><p>When you go ahead to add an <span class="bold">Image block </span>into your presentation, the first thing that opens up is the <span class="bold">Image Picker</span>. It lets you choose from stock images fetched from <a href="https://unsplash.com/images">Unsplash</a> and <a href="https://unsplash.com/images">Giphy</a>. A set of 30 images are loaded in the first fetch and more are fetched as you scroll down. You also have a <span class="bold">search bar </span>to let you search for the kind of images you are looking for. There's also an <span class="bold">upload button </span>to let you upload an image from your desktop if you want.</p><ul class="single"><li class="image" style="width: 75%"><img src="../images/projects-chronicle-image-insertion.gif" alt="Image block insertion mechanism in Chronicle using forward slash menu"><span>Image block insertion mechanism in Chronicle using "Forward slash menu"</span></li></ul><p>Once you have an Image block in place, you can go ahead and change it's properties from the <span class="bold">Contextual menu</span>. From there you can choose to <span class="bold">Replace</span>, <span class="bold">Crop</span>, or edit the <span class="bold">Shape </span>of the image. In there, you also have block actions common to all blocks like - <span class="bold">Bring to Front</span>, <span class="bold">Bring to Back</span>, <span class="bold">Duplicate</span>, and <span class="bold">Delete</span></p><ul class="single"><li class="image" style="width: 75%"><img src="../images/projects-chronicle-image-editing.gif" alt="Image block editing mechanism in Chronicle using Contextual menu"><span>Image block editing mechanism in Chronicle using "Contextual menu"</span></li></ul><h3>Icon block</h3><p>You add the <span class="bold">Icon block </span>from the forward slash menu. </p><ul class="single"><li class="image" style="width: 75%"><img src="../images/projects-chronicle-icon-insertion.gif" alt="Icon block insertion mechanism in Chronicle using forward slash menu"><span>Icon block insertion mechanism in Chronicle using "Forward slash menu"</span></li></ul><p>Using either the <span class="bold">Contextual menu </span>or <span class="bold">Block toolbar</span>, you can choose to <span class="bold">Replace</span>, or edit the <span class="bold">Shape</span>, and <span class="bold">Size (S/M/L) </span>of the icon.</p><ul class="single"><li class="image" style="width: 75%"><img src="../images/projects-chronicle-icon-toolbar-editing.gif" alt="Icon block editing mechanism in Chronicle using Block toolbar"><span>Icon block editing mechanism in Chronicle using "Block toolbar"</span></li></ul><ul class="single"><li class="image" style="width: 75%"><img src="../images/projects-chronicle-icon-menu-editing.gif" alt="Icon block editing mechanism in Chronicle using Contextual menu"><span>Icon block editing mechanism in Chronicle using "Contextual menu"</span></li></ul><h3>Video block    </h3><p>You add the block from the <span class="bold">Forward slash menu</span>, and using the <span class="bold">Block toolbar</span>, you can choose to edit  <span class="bold">URL</span>, <span class="bold">Start time</span>, or <span class="bold">Navigate </span>back to the original video.
