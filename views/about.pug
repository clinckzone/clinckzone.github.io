    p Hello, my name is Divyanshu Tiwari, and I am a 4th  (Pre-final) year undergraduate student of Architecture at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, India. I am primarily interested in HCI research in the domain of Tangible interfaces and interaction. I am currently looking for 
      span.bold research internship 
      | opportunities for 2021 summers.

    p For more details about me, please go through the rest of this page and the website. You can also have a look at my

    h2 Research Interests
    p My research interests primarily lie in the area of 
      span.bold Human Computer Interaction (HCI) 
      | with a focus on 
      span.bold Tangible Interfaces
      | , 
      span.bold Emergent Interfaces 
      | and 
      span.bold Novel Interaction Techniques
      | . I want to contribute to the future of human-computer interfaces, especially to the area of tangible interfaces. I want to work on ways their highly specific appication area can be bought to more generic ones so that they can provide an experience which is as versatile as that given by VR through its virtual world. 
    
    p I do understand that for this to happen, it will take radical advances in material sciences and is very possibly a goal beyond my own lifetime, but I still feel that it is important for HCI researchers to atleast take the responsibility of directing this progress by developing prototypes that push the boundaries of tangible interaction space so that it may give new ideas to material scientists and others regarding their own research.
