    p Hello, my name is Divyanshu Tiwari, and I am a 4th  (Pre-final) year undergraduate student of Architecture at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, India. Broadly speaking, I am mainly interested in exploring new and creative ways of interacting with technology.

    p For more details about me, please go through the rest of this page and the website. You can also have a look at my 
      a(href="https://itp.nyu.edu/shows/winter2017/into-the-darkness") resume
      | . Also, I am currently looking for 
      span.bold research internship 
      | opportunities for 2021 summers.

    h2 Research Interests
    p My research interests primarily lie in the area of 
      span.bold Human Computer Interaction (HCI) 
      | with a focus on 
      span.bold Tangible Interfaces
      | , 
      span.bold Emergent Interfaces 
      | and 
      span.bold Novel Interaction Techniques
      | . I want to contribute to the future of human-computer interfaces, especially to the future of tangible interfaces. I want to work on ways their highly specific appication area can be bought to more generic ones so that they can provide as versatile experience as VR does through its virtual world. 
    
    p I do understand that for this to happen, it will take radical advances in material sciences and is very possibly a goal beyond my own lifetime, but I still feel that it is important for HCI researchers to atleast take the responsibility of directing this progress by developing prototypes that push the boundaries of tangible interaction space so that it may give new ideas to material scientists and others regarding their own research. A really good example that that in my view demonstrates this is the

    h2 Experience
    p I worked at Razorpay as a Full-Stack Designer during the summers of 2019 where I designed and developed an 
      a(href="https://www.figma.com/file/dqH2lFZQsK2kbrXqssqPNO/Razorpay-Internship-Work?node-id=0%3A1") interactive section
      |  for their company website with the aim of recommending product solutions in accordance with their user needs.
 
    p I also worked at the 
      span.bold Net-Zed Lab 
      | in IIT Roorkee as a research assistant during the winters of 2018. I worked under the supervision of 
      a(href="https://www.iitr.ac.in/departments/AR/pages/People+Rajasekhar_Elangovan.html") Dr. Elangovan Rajasekar
      |  in the area of Building Automation where I developed a 
      a(href="../projects/projects-smart-ac") prototype
      |  that automated the functioning of an AC remote Control.
